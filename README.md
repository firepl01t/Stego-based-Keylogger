#Stego-based-Keylogger


A keylogger system based on Steganography that takes advantage of an innocuous Social Network

Identity theft through keyloggers has become very popular the
last years. One of the most common ways to intercept and steal
victim's data is to use a keylogger that transfers data back to the
attacker. Covert keyloggers exist either as hardware or software.
In the former case they are introduced as devices that can be
attached to a computer (e.g. USB sticks), while in the latter case
they try to stay invisible and undetectable as a software in the
operating system. Writing a static keylogger which operates
locally in victim's machine is not very complex. In contrast, the
creation of covert communication between the attacker and the
victim, and still remain undetectable is more sophisticated. In
such a scenario we have to define how data can be delivered to
the attacker and how we can make an efficient use of the channel
that transfers the information over the network in order to stay
undetectable. In this project we propose a keylogger system based
on Steganography that takes advantage of a seemingly innocuous
Social Network (Tumblr) in order to avoid direct communication
between the victim and the attacker. A security analysis is also
discussed by presenting experimental results of the system and
describing issues regarding surveillance resistance of the system
and limitations.

In this project core contributors were also Megan Thomas and Thomas Yorkshire. 
This study was implemented for the Network Security module 
of the University of Birmingham during our M.Sc. course (academic year: 2012/13).
